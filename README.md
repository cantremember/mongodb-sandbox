# mongodb-sandbox

Launch a stand-alone MongoDB Topology for use within a Test Suite.

  [![Build status][travis-img]][travis-url]
  [![License][license-img]][license-url]


## Purpose

`mongodb-sandbox` provides an easy way to run a self-contained MongoDB Topology
within the runtime execution of a Test Suite,
participating in its lifecycle hooks;


## Installation

```bash
npm install --save-dev mongodb-sandbox
```

This module supports Node.js 6.x and above.


## Features

All Collections in the Sandbox Database get purged at the end of every Test Case.

As a safety measure, immediately after launching its Topology's daemon,
the [Lifecycle](JSDOC.md#Lifecycle) connects to the [Sandbox](JSDOC.md#Sandbox) and detects the presence of Documents.
After all, if it's truly a volatile Sandbox, then *no Documents should be found,* right?
If any **are** found, then it's possible that the Client has connected to a "real" Database by mistake;

- the Test Suite gets terminated
- the "real" Database is left untouched

[MongoDB binaries](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center) are automatically downloaded, if not already present.
By default, each version of the binaries is cached locally to ensure that your Test Suite runs quickly on subsequent launches.

The binaries are downloaded on-demand, vs. during 'postinstall'.
Your first Test Suite execution will take some extra time on launch.
The Test Case timeout is programatically extended to 90s to accomodate the time spent on

- downloading the MongoDB binaries
- launching the Topology


## Examples

> Please consult the [JSDocs](./JSDOC.md) for additional Examples.

Here are ways to embed a [Lifecycle](JSDOC.md#Lifecycle) into your Test Framework,
and within a Test Case, connect your own [MongoClient](https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/blob/master/lib/mongo_client.js) instance
to the [Sandbox](JSDOC.md#Sandbox).

The trick here is to capture the Test Framework context and provide it to the Lifecycle
so that it can extend the Test Case timeout, as mentioned in [Features](#features).

### Example for the Mocha Framework

In [mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha), use a `before` block to capture the Test Framework context,
construct your Lifecycle around it,
and then register the rest of the hooks into the Framework.

```javascript
const { expect } = require('chai');
const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');
const { createSandbox } = require('mongodb-sandbox');


const sandbox = createSandbox();

before(function() {
  const lifecycle = sandbox.lifecycle(this);

  before(lifecycle.beforeAll);
  beforeEach(lifecycle.beforeEach);
  afterEach(lifecycle.afterEach);
  after(lifecycle.afterAll);
});


describe('the Sandbox', () => {
  it('is running', () => {
    expect(sandbox.isRunning).to.equal(true);
  });

  it('can be pinged', () => {
    const { url } = sandbox.config;

    return MongoClient.connect(url, { useNewUrlParser: true })
    .then((client) => {
      return client.db().admin().ping()
      .then((response) => {
        expect(response).to.deep.equal({ ok: 1 });

        return client.close();
      });
    });
  });
});
```

### Examples for other Frameworks

Please submit a [Pull Request](./pulls) if you come up with a good one :+1: .

That'll likely involve

- enhancing the [Lifecycle](JSDOC.md#Lifecycle) to detect & adjust the Test Framework context
- adding a good-lookin' [Example](#examples)
- checking it off the [TODO](#todo) list :ballot_box_with_check:

## On the Shoulders of Giants

`mongodb-sandbox` is an assemblage of

- [mongodb-prebuilt](https://github.com/winfinit/mongodb-prebuilt)
- [portfinder](https://github.com/indexzero/node-portfinder)
- [mongodb-topology-manager](https://github.com/mongodb-js/mongodb-topology-manager)

The module produces additional logging via [debug](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug).

```bash
// when running the Test Suite for your project ...
DEBUG=mongodb-sandbox npm test
```

## Why Mocha?

> C'mon buddy, that's the ["nobody ever got fired for buying IBM equipment"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt)
> of JavaScript testing frameworks.
> Couldn't you use something a bit *cooler?*

Honestly, I tried, but

- [tape](https://github.com/substack/tape) doesn't seem to have the necessary [Lifecycle](./JSDOC.md#lifecycle) hook support.
- <a name="ava"></a>
  [ava](https://github.com/avajs/ava)'s multi-process concurrency makes it *incredibly difficult* to start up a Sandbox,
  particularly at the juncture of allocating & reserving a unique port.
  So for the moment, `ava` and other concurrent-running Test Frameworks **are not supported** pending a [TODO](#todo).
- I find [jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) to be too opinionated and React-focused.

Whereas [mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha) is perfectly suited for the job at hand.

So *that's* why.
